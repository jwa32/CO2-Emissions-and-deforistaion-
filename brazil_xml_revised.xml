    <abstract>
    Brazil has made important progress in slowing deforestation in the Amazon region. As of 2013,
    deforestation had declined 70% below its ten-year average ending in 2005, making Brazil the
    global leader in climate change mitigation.    
    It was achieved while soy and beef production
    continued to grow, and with a large increase in land formally designated as indigenous peoples’
    territories. These important strides towards a new “low-emission” model of rural development are
    at risk, however.

        Climbing soy prices, the end to some of the voluntary agreements that helped
    slow <problem probType="deforest">deforestaion </problem> (such as the Soy Moratorium), and a shortage of <problem probType="carbonGas">cattle pasture</problem> suitable for
    conversion to <problem probType="deforest">soy</problem>, could come together to drive <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem> rates back up. In 2013, for
      example, <problem probType="deforest"></problem> was 28% higher than in 2012.

            Earth Innovation Institute, together with
    partner organizations, has been leading a multi-sector dialogue in Brazil to plug an important
    gap in the Amazon <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem> story, and prevent a reversal of the decline in <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem>
    rates. There are at least eight different processes underway in the <place>Brazilian Amazon</place> region that
    are designed to slow <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem>. However, these processes use different metrics of success,
    they operate with different spatial scales and over different time periods, and they are
    severely deficient in positive incentives for farmers who are doing their part to slow
    <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem>. In other words, <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem> strategies are being discussed in many different
    “languages”, creating an important obstacle to the convergence that will be needed to continue
    the recent trend towards lower <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem>. The <org>“Multi-Sector Deforestation Agreement for the
    Amazon”</org> is designed to help achieve this convergence. It establishes a set of incremental
    milestones for <solution solType="prevention">reducing deforestation</solution> through 2020, when the decline in <problem probType="deforest">deforestation</problem> will
    achieve 90% below the ten-year average and when all clearing of primary forest would be 90%
    below the historical average and would be compensated by new natural forest.
