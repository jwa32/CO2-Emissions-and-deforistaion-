Global overview of carbon
pricing initiatives
As of <date>2018,5</date> <quntity>45</quntity> national and <quantity>25</quantity> subnational
jurisdictions6
are putting a price on <object>carbon,</object>
as <action>shown</action> in Figure 4.7
<object>Carbon</object> pricing initiatives
implemented and scheduled for implementation
would cover <quantity>11 gigatons</quantity> of <object>carbon dioxide</object>
equivalent (GtCO2
e) or about <quantity>20 percent</quantity> of global
GHG emissions, as <action>displayed</action> in Figure 5, compared
to 8 GtCO2
e or about <quantity>15 percent</quantity> in <date>2017.8</date>
This
increase primarily due to the expected coverage
of the <location>China</location> national ETS. While this trend brings
the global coverage of GHG emissions closer to
the <orginization>Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition’s</orginization> (CPLC’s)
target of <quantity>25 percent</quantity> by <date>2020,</date> further progress will
be needed to reach this goal.9
<object>Carbon</object> prices vary substantially, from less than
<quantity>US$1/tCO2</quantity>
e to a maximum of <quantity>US$139/tCO2</quantity>
e, as
<action>shown</action> in Figure 6 and Figure 7. Most initiatives <action>saw</action> an
<action>increase</action> in their <date>2018</date> price levels compared to those
in <date>2017</date>. One substantial change was the <action>growth</action> in the
<orginization>European Union Allowance</orginization> (EUA) price from <quantity>€5/tCO2</quantity>
e
to <quantity>€13/tCO2</quantity>
e (<quantity>US$7/tCO2</quantity>
e to <quantity>US$16/tCO2</quantity>
e) as more
certainty developed on the future of the <orginzation>European
Union</orginzation> (EU) ETS in the post-<date>2020</date> period. In addition,
planned tax rate increases occurred, including
the escalation of the <location>France</location> <object>carbon</object> tax rate from
<quantity>€30.5/tCO2e</quantity> to <quantity>€44.6/tCO2e</quantity> <quantity>(US$38/tCO2e to
US$55/tCO2e)</quantity> and the <location>Switzerland</location> <object>carbon</object> tax rate
from <quantity>CHF84/tCO2e</quantity> to <quantity>CHF96/tCO2e</quantity> <quantity>(US$88/tCO2e
to US$101/tCO2</quantity>
e). Despite these developments over
the past year, most jurisdictions have <object>carbon</object> prices
that are substantially lower than those needed to be
consistent with the <document>Paris Agreement,</document> as <action>displayed</action> in
Figure 7.
Governments <action>raised</action> approximately <quantity>US$33 billion</quantity>
in <object>carbon</object> pricing revenues in <date>2017,</date> the source of
which was allowance auctions, direct payments
to meet compliance obligations and <object>carbon tax
receipts.</object> This represents an increase of nearly
<quantity>US$11 billion</quantity> compared to the <quantity>US$22 billion</quantity> raised
in <date>2016</date>. Reasons for this increase include auction
revenues from the newly launched <location>Ontario</location> ETS and
revenues from the new <object>carbon taxes</object> in <location>Alberta, Chile</location>
and <location>Colombia.</location> Existing initiatives also contributed to
this trend, including a larger number of allowances
bought at auctions in the <location>California</location> ETS combined
with higher auction sale prices,10 and an increase in
the EUA price and the <object>carbon tax</object> rate in <location>France</location>. The
EU ETS remains the largest source of <object>carbon</object> pricing
revenues due to its size, followed by the <object>carbon
taxes</object> in <location>,</location> <location>Sweden</location> and <location>Japan,</location> as illustrated in
Figure 8.</root>
