        <p >The single biggest reason to fell trees, according to official figures, is to create new pastures for cattle, and during our visit we saw countless herds grazing on land that used to be rainforest. Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce the clearances with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But this approach is being overturned by Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers who have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes.</p>

        <p>The rate at which rainforest is being cleared in the Brazilian Amazon has increased in recent yearsâ€”and under the new president, Jair Bolsanaro, it's expected to accelerate further. The forest is often burned to clear it, with the land then being used for cattle pasture or farm fields.</p>
