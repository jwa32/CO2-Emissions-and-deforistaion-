        <h2> CO2 Levels</h2>
        <h4>The world’s existing power plants, industrial equipment, vehicles and other<br/>
            CO₂-emitters are on track to pump out enough carbon dioxide by midcentury to blow <br/>
            past that target, researchers report July 1 in Nature. Add in future power plants that <br/>
            are already planned, permitted or under construction, and we could emit enough by 2033 <br/>
            to raise average global atmospheric temperatures by 1.5 degrees, the researchers say. <br/>
            If we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, then “we cannot invest more in fossil fuel <br/>
            power or infrastructure,” says Thorsten Mauritsen, a physical climate scientist at <br/>
            Stockholm University who was not involved with the work. “Everything we do from now has <br/>
            to change direction and not use fossil fuels.” <br/>
