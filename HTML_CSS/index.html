<td> NEPSTAD:....You know, really, every time a little droplet of water leaves a leaf and goes<br>
 into vapor, it's absorbing energy and it's cooling things down. And the Amazon is so big that <br>
 if we lose it, it's going to change the <br>
 way air and energy move around the planet, and that means our climate will change.<br>
 For me, that's something that really ties us to the<br>
 health of the Amazon wherever we are on the planet.</td>

At last count, more than 93,000 fires were alight in the Brazilian Amazon, up more than 60 percent from the<br>
same time last year, and the highest number since 2010. According to NASA, this year’s fires are more intensethan in previous years, too.<br>
But Brazil’s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has only been keeping fire records since 1998, and<br>
two decades isn’t long in the life of a forest where trees live for centuries and humans have been setting <br>
fires for millennia.

existing carbon dioxide. If tropical deforestation were a country, according to the World Resources Institute, <br>
it would rank third in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, behind China and the U.S.<br>
The numbers are grim, but many conservationists see reasons for hope. A movement is under way to preserve existing<br>
forest ecosystems
and restore lost tree cover.</td>
