    NASA's Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space
        Station <org>(ECOSTRESS)</org>
    <action>captured</action> imagery of fires in the <place>Amazon</place> regions of
        <place>Brazil</place> and <place>Bolivia</place> on <date>Aug. 23, 2019.</date>
    The red areas in the images - in <place>eastern Bolivia</place> and
        <place>northern Brazil</place> - are where surface temperatures exceeded the maximum
    measurable temperature of the instrument's sensor (approximately 220
        degrees Fahrenheit, or 104 degrees Celsius), highlighting the burning
    areas along the fire fronts. The dark, wispy areas indicate thick smoke - thick enough to
        <action>obscure</action> much of the fire from view. The measurements <action>cover</action>
    areas of about 77 by 77 yards
    (70 by 70 meters) each, or about the size of a football
    field. The primary mission of <org>ECOSTRESS</org> is to measure the temperature of
        plants from the vantage point of the <place>International Space
        Station.</place> However, it can also <action>detect</action> other heat-related
    phenomena like heat waves, <object>volcanoes</object> and fires. Due to the <place>space
        station's</place> unique orbit, <org>ECOSTRESS</org>
    <action>acquires</action> imagery of the same areas at different times of day as it
        <action>passes</action> by overhead - instead of <action>crossing over</action> each area at
    the same time of day like satellites in some other orbits do. This is
    particularly important when trying to <action>acquire</action> cloud-free imagery over
    perennially cloudy areas like the <place>Amazon.</place>
