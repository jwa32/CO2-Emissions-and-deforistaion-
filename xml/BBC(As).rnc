# 2019-10-26 ebb: This schema is now working to validate one BBC article, 
# but the markup is not very informative because it's wrapping large "blobs" of text.
# This XML should be more refined to help you target issues about solutions and causes, and track details in your collection of articles, so we need to revisit this.
# Maybe it's a starting point that we can build on.
