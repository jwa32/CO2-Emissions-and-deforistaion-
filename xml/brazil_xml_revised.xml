    <abstract>
    Brazil has made important progress in slowing deforestation in the Amazon region. As of 2013,
    deforestation had declined 70% below its ten-year average ending in 2005, making Brazil the
    global leader in climate change mitigation.    
    It was achieved while soy and beef production
    continued to grow, and with a large increase in land formally designated as indigenous peoples’
    territories. These important strides towards a new “low-emission” model of rural development are
    at risk, however.

        Climbing <product>soy</product> prices, the end to some of the voluntary agreements that helped
    slow <action>deforestation</action> (such as the Soy Moratorium), and a shortage of <object>cattle pasture</object> suitable for
    conversion to <object>soy</object>, could come together to drive <action>deforestation</action> rates back up. In <date>2013</date>, for
    example, <action>deforestation</action> was <quantity>28%</quantity> higher than in <date>2012</date>.

            Earth Innovation Institute, together with
    partner organizations, has been leading a multi-sector dialogue in Brazil to plug an important
    gap in the Amazon <action>deforestation</action> story, and prevent a reversal of the decline in <action>deforestation</action>
    rates. There are at least <quantity>eight</quantity> different processes underway in the Brazilian Amazon region that
    are <action>designed</action> to slow <action>deforestation</action>. However, these processes use different metrics of success,
    they operate with different spatial scales and over different time periods, and they are
    severely deficient in positive incentives for farmers who are doing their part to slow
    <action>deforestation</action>. In other words, <action>deforestation</action> strategies are being <action>discussed</action> in many different
    “languages”, creating an important obstacle to the convergence that will be needed to continue
    the recent trend towards lower <action>deforestation</action>. The “Multi-Sector Deforestation Agreement for the
    Amazon” is designed to help achieve this convergence. It establishes a set of incremental
    milestones for <action>reducing deforestation</action> through <date>2020</date>, when the decline in <action>deforestation</action> will
    achieve <quantity>90%</quantity> below the <quantity>ten-year</quantity> average and when all clearing of primary forest would be <quantity>90%</quantity>
    below the historical average and would be compensated by new natural forest.
