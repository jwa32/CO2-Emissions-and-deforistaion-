    <action>captured</action> imagery of fires in the <location>Amazon</location> regions of
        <location>Brazil</location> and <location>Bolivia</location> on <date>Aug. 23, 2019.</date>
    The <color>red</color> areas in the images - in <location>eastern Bolivia</location> and
        <location>northern Brazil</location> - are where surface temperatures exceeded the maximum
    measurable temperature of the instrument's <equip>sensor</equip> (approximately <temp>220
        degrees Fahrenheit</temp>, or <temp>104 degrees Celsius</temp>), highlighting the burning
    areas along the fire fronts. The dark, wispy areas indicate thick smoke - thick enough to
        <action>obscure</action> much of the fire from view. The measurements <action>cover</action>
    areas of about <measurement>77 by 77 yards</measurement>
    <measurment>(70 by 70 meters)</measurment> each, or about the size of a <equip>football</equip>
    field. The primary mission of <company>ECOSTRESS</company> is to measure the temperature of
        <equip>plants</equip> from the vantage point of the <location>International Space
        Station.</location> However, it can also <action>detect</action> other heat-related
    phenomena like heat waves, <object>volcanoes</object> and fires. Due to the <location>space
        station's</location> unique orbit, <company>ECOSTRESS</company>
    <action>acquires</action> imagery of the same areas at different times of day as it
        <action>passes</action> by overhead - instead of <action>crossing over</action> each area at
    the same time of day like <equip>satellites</equip> in some other orbits do. This is
    particularly important when trying to <action>acquire</action> cloud-free imagery over
    perennially cloudy areas like the <location>Amazon.</location>
